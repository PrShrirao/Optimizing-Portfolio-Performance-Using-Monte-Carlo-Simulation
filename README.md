# Optimizing-Portfolio-Performance-Using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
### The objective of this project is to conduct portfolio optimization using Monte Carlo simulation. Specifically, the project aims to:
1) Construct an optimal investment portfolio comprising a diverse set of assets.
2) Maximize expected returns while minimizing portfolio volatility.
3) Analyze the implications of different asset weightings on portfolio performance.
4) Provide insights into the risk-return trade-off and the efficient frontier.
I will simulate weights on individual companies within a given portfolio to obtain an understanding on what return to risk is desired by the individual.
